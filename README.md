### Summary
This project is the Ontario Engineering Competition 2018 Programming Challenge.

Competitors will have 8 hours to develop and iterate on a BrokerBot.  Each BrokerBot
has access to a virtual stock exchange where they can buy and sell stocks.  The bot which
goes home with the most $$ at the end of the day wins.

### How to contribute
This app is far from complete, the next steps are to:
 * Improve the dashboard to better display information about the market
 * Introduce a news simulation which generate headlines based on the future stock performance

To contribute you should fork this repository, hack away and open a pull request.
